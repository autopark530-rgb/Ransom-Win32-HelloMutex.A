# Legacy systems & recent high-impact ransomware cases (2024‚Äì2025)

Here are five recent high-impact ransomware cases (2024-2025) where legacy systems or under-maintained infrastructure played a significant role in the breach chain. Given your offensive/forensics-inclined mindset, this focuses on attacker footholds, lateral movement via weak/legacy controls, and operational impact.

1. **Change Healthcare (subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group) ‚Äî Feb 2024**  
   **Summary:** The breach, attributed to ALPHV/BlackCat, impacted Change Healthcare‚Äôs systems (a major U.S. healthcare insurer/clearing-house). The incident led to claims-processing outages, massive data exfiltration and extortion.  
   **Legacy / Weakness factors:**  
   - Initial access via stolen credentials and a remote-access (Citrix Virtual Apps & Desktops) portal **without multifactor authentication (MFA)**.  
   - The portal granted lateral movement into large portions of the network; attackers deployed ransomware 9 days after initial access.  
   **Attacker chain insight:** Simple credential theft + weak control ‚Üí pivot via remote access ‚Üí lateral spread ‚Üí extortion. A textbook ‚Äúunsupported/under-defended access path‚Äù scenario.  
   **Impact:** Estimated ~190 million individuals‚Äô data affected (the largest US healthcare record breach).  
   **Lessons for forensics / OPSEC:**  
   - Dead credentials + no MFA = straightforward access.  
   - Lateral movement likely via pre-existing trust between remote access environment and internal network (legacy connectivity assumptions).  
   - Response often becomes isolation of the entire network rather than targeted segmentation.

2. **Legacy IT / OT in Manufacturing (undisclosed food-manufacturer) ‚Äî Early 2024**  
   **Summary:** A North American food-manufacturer experienced a coordinated ransomware incident where attackers moved from IT into production (OT) systems, halting production for ~3 weeks.  
   **Legacy / Weakness factors:**  
   - Outdated production/automation systems with insufficient backup/recovery.  
   - Poor segmentation between IT and OT environments.  
   **Attacker chain insight:** Attacker uses IT foothold ‚Üí lateral into OT (often via legacy ICS/SCADA or unpatched HMIs) ‚Üí major operational disruption. Classic legacy-system industrial ransomware playbook.  
   **Lessons:** Exploit weakest link (legacy manufacturing systems) to maximize downtime and extortion leverage.

3. **Exploitation of legacy Windows OS in the tech-sector (2024-2025)**  
   **Summary:** According to Trustwave, over 20,000 hosts were found using unsupported Windows OS (Windows 2012/2008/2007) in 2025, which remain critically vulnerable to ransomware/legacy exploit frameworks.  
   **Legacy / Weakness factors:** Unsupported OS = no patches, easier exploit chains (e.g., EternalBlue, SMB mis-configs).  
   **Attacker chain insight:** Access via exploit path on old OS ‚Üí low-hanging fruit for ransomware actors.  
   **Why include:** While not a single ‚Äúcase‚Äù with full post-mortem, the trend underscores the legacy-system vector enabling ransomware at scale ‚Äî valuable for red-team/forensics mapping.

4. **Leveraged vulnerability in file-transfer product: GoAnywhere MFT (CVE-2025-10035) ‚Äî Sept 2025**  
   **Summary:** Active exploitation of CVE-2025-10035 (a deserialization RCE) in GoAnywhere MFT (versions up to v7.8.3). Attackers used this to deploy the Medusa ransomware.  
   **Legacy / Weakness factors:** Use of outdated software version (legacy-like), license-verification bypass, publicly-exposed application.  
   **Attacker chain insight:** Vulnerable legacy/aged application exposed to internet ‚Üí remote code execution ‚Üí deploy ransomware.  
   **Importance:** Shows that ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù includes aging business applications, not just OSes.

5. **Exploitation of zero-day in legacy kernel driver (Windows Common Log File System Driver) ‚Äî April 2025**  
   **Summary:** Exploitation of CVE-2025-29824 (CLFS driver zero-day) led to ransomware deployment (extension ‚Äú!READ_ME_REXX2!.txt‚Äù).  
   **Legacy / Weakness factors:** Kernel-driver exploit; older drivers or lagging patches can enable escalation even on otherwise modern systems.  
   **Attacker chain insight:** Post-access privilege escalation (via older/lazy driver) ‚Üí memory-dump of LSASS ‚Üí credential harvesting ‚Üí ransomware.  
   **Takeaway:** Forensic investigations must look for kernel-level compromise signs and lateral movement enabled by legacy drivers.

‚úÖ **Summary Table**

| Case | Sector | Legacy Weakness | Access Vector | Attacker Outcome |
|------|--------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Change Healthcare | Healthcare | Remote access portal w/o MFA | Stolen creds ‚Üí Citrix | Massive breach, ransom paid |
| Food-manufacturer | Manufacturing/Industrial | IT ‚Üí OT segmentation gap, outdated systems | IT foothold ‚Üí OT encryption | 3 weeks shutdown |
| Tech hosts (broad) | Technology | Unsupported Windows OS | Exploit frameworks | Large-scale exposure |
| GoAnywhere MFT vuln | Multiple sectors | Outdated application version | RCE via deserialization | Medusa deployment |
| CLFS driver zero-day | Various | Legacy driver vulnerability | Privilege escalation ‚Üí dumping | Targeted ransomware |

üß† **Operational Implications (for your tactic / forensics mindset)**  
- **Recon stage:** Legacy systems (unsupported OS, exposed remote-access, old applications) are high-ROI targets ‚Äî large orgs frequently neglect them.  
- **Initial access & pivot:** Stolen credentials or exploits against old externally-facing portals/apps are common entry points; weak segmentation + flat networks enable movement.  
- **Persistence & escalation:** Older drivers/tools can be abused for privilege escalation (e.g., CLFS exploit). Forensics must search for kernel-level compromise and memory-dump artifacts.  
- **Impact amplification:** Legacy OT or business-critical systems produce longer downtimes and higher extortion leverage.  
- **Defender shortfall:** Many organisations treat legacy systems as ‚Äújust works‚Äù ‚Äî attackers treat them as primary vectors.
